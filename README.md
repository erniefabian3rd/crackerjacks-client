# Crackerjacks

Plan, Connect, Explore - Your Ultimate Baseball Park Companion.

## Application Overview

As a lifelong baseball fan and member of a sports family, my dad, brother, wife, and me take a trip each year around Fatherâ€™s Day to watch a few games at a baseball park that we have not yet visited. When planning for the trip as team schedules are released, we are left to spend countless hours doing our own research, answering questions like: What teams are playing multiple games in a row? What does the stadium look like? Is it highly rated or potentially a waste of money? Etc.

Though Google and a Facebook post asking for recommendations tend to be helpful when making our decision, what if there was a website/application that was a one-stop-shop for those planning their own family baseball trip? This is where Crackerjacks comes into play.

Crackerjacks is a React/Django application that gives baseball enthusiasts access to team information, park details and photos, average user ratings, and social interaction with other baseball fans/users. Ultimately, the goal of Crackerjacks is to take the stress out of planning a family trip and make it fun and enjoyable for everyone involved.
